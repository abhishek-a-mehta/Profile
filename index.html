      </h2>
      <p class="intro">As an electrical engineer I always hated Computer Engineering but this changed just after college when I got my 1st job in an IT company. I started liking stuff and it really interested me to do more work around, soon I was one of the best performers in my team, learned Javascript to automate a few day to day tasks and then I started learning HTML & CSS to build my website and here I am today!</div>
